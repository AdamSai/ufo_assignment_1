The bachelor project must document the student's understanding and ability to reflect over professional practices and application of theory and methods in relation to a practical problem statement. The problem statement should be central to the education and profession, formulated by the student, possibly in collaboration with a private or public company. The school must approve of the problem statement\cite[my translation]{curriculum}. In more simpler terms: The student must show, that they can apply the knowledge they have gained during their education in real life business scenarios.
